"# AppiumDemo" 
THis project is very difficult to setup so I'd look up a tutorial before trying to setup this repo

Requirements:
JRE 19
Android ADK
Nodejs 18.12.1
Appium 2.0.0.48 (DO NOT DO A NORMAL INSTALLATION OF APPIUM USING NODE, you will need to run where appium to find the appium
directory and delete everything appium related in order to not run into dependency issues. run appium install with @next in order
to install 2.0.0 beta)
Android Studio to run Virtual Machine
Maven 3.8.6
Appium inspector
